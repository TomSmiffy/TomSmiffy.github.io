    <h1>Identifying Attack Methods - Glossary of Terms</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Back door</b><br>
      A backdoor refers to any method by which authorized and unauthorized users are able to get around normal security measures and gain high level user access (aka root access) on a computer system, network or software application. Once they're in, cybercriminals can use a backdoor to steal personal and financial data, install additional malware, and hijack devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Denial of Service (DoS) attack</b><br>
      A denial-of-service (DoS) attack is a type of cyber-attack in which a malicious actor aims to render a computer or other device unavailable to its intended users by interrupting the device's normal functioning. DoS attacks typically function by overwhelming or flooding a targeted machine with requests until normal traffic is unable to be processed, resulting in denial-of-service to addition users. A DoS attack is characterized by using a single computer to launch the attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dictionary attack</b><br>
      An attempt to break into a password-protected computer or computer system with a software program that successively tries all the words in a large dictionary or other word list.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack</b><br>
      Distributed denial-of-service attacks target websites and online services. The aim is to overwhelm them with more traffic than the server or network can accommodate. The goal is to render the website or service inoperable <br>
      <i>The biggest DDoS attack to date took place in February of 2020. At its peak, this attack saw incoming traffic at a rate of 2.3 terabits per second (Tbps). AWS reported that it mitigated this massive attack but did not disclose which customer was targeted by the attack.
      The attackers responsible used hijacked Connection-less Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (CLDAP) web servers. CLDAP is a protocol for user directories. It is an alternative to LDAP, an older version of the protocol. CLDAP has been used in multiple DDoS attacks in recent years.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ICMP attack</b><br>
      An Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) flood attack, also known as a Ping flood attack, is a common Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack in which an attacker attempts to overwhelm a targeted device with ICMP echo-requests (pings).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>IP spoofing</b><br>
      In computer networking, IP address spoofing or IP spoofing is the creation of Internet Protocol packets with a false source IP address, for the purpose of impersonating another computing system.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Logic bomb</b><br>
      A logic bomb is a piece of code intentionally inserted into a software system that will set off a malicious function when specified conditions are met.<br>
      <i>On 19 July 2019, David Tinley, a contract employee, pleaded guilty for programming logic bombs within the software he created for Siemens Corporation. The software was intentionally made to malfunction after a certain amount of time, requiring the company to hire him to fix it for a fee. The logic bombs went undetected for two years but was then discovered while he was out of town and had to hand over the administrative password to his software.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Macro virus</b><br>
      A macro virus is a computer virus written in the same macro language that is used for software applications, such as word processing programs. Microsoft Word and Excel are two examples of applications that feature powerful macro languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Man-in-the-middle attack</b><br>
      In cryptography and computer security, a man-in-the-middle attack is an attack where the attacker either eavesdrops or secretly relays and possibly alters the communications between two parties who believe that they are directly communicating with each other.<br>
      <i>In 2014, Lenovo installed MITM (SSL Hijacking) adware called Superfish on their Windows PCs.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mathematical attack</b><br>
      A mathematical attack involves the use of computation based on the mathematical properties of the encryption algorithm to attempt to decrypt data.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Password guessing </b><br>
      They are one of the most common vectors used to compromise websites. The process is very simple, and the attackers basically try multiple combinations of usernames and passwords until they find one that works
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ping of death </b><br>
      Ping of Death (a.k.a. PoD) is a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack in which an attacker attempts to crash, destabilize, or freeze the targeted computer or service by sending malformed or oversized packets using a simple ping command.<br>
      <i>The original Ping of Death attack has mostly gone the way of the dinosaurs; devices created after 1998 are generally protected against this type of attack. Some legacy equipment may still be vulnerable. A new Ping of Death attack for IPv6 packets for Microsoft Windows was discovered more recently, and it was patched in mid 2013. Cloudflare DDoS Protection mitigates Ping of Death attacks by dropping malformed packets before they reach the targeted host computer.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Polymorphic</b><br>
      Polymorphic malware is a type of malware that constantly changes its identifiable features in order to evade detection.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Port scanner</b><br>
      A port scan is a method for determining which ports on a network are open. Running a port scan on a network or server reveals which ports are open and listening (receiving information), as well as revealing the presence of security devices such as firewalls that are present between the sender and the target.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Replay attack</b><br>
      A replay attack is a form of network attack in which a valid data transmission is maliciously or fraudulently repeated or delayed. This is carried out either by the originator or by an adversary who intercepts the data and re-transmits it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Smurf attack</b><br>
      A Smurf attack is a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack in which an attacker attempts to flood a targeted server with Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sniffer</b><br>
      Also known as wiretapping, eavesdropping, packet sniffing, network sniffing, and snorting (wireless networks).<br>
      Sniffers are a type of networking tool that is able to inspect packets of data traveling through a network. Sniffers may either be special software created to capture data packets or a physical hardware device that is connected directly to a network. In the case of software sniffers, the sniffer must be installed on a computer that has access to the target network. Data packets captured by sniffers are usually legitimate communications from end users, however, there are times when a malicious actor may be lurking on the network. A hacker can utilize network sniffers to capture data that may potentially reveal usernames, passwords, and other sensitive information.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Snooping</b><br>
      Snooping, in a security context, is unauthorized access to another person's or company's data. The practice is similar to eavesdropping but is not necessarily limited to gaining access to data during its transmission.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Spoofing attack</b><br>
      Spoofing is when someone or something pretends to be something else in an attempt to gain our confidence, get access to our systems, steal data, steal money, or spread malware. Spoofing attacks come in many forms, primarily:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Email spoofing</li>
        <li>Website and/or URL spoofing</li>
        <li>Caller ID spoofing</li>
        <li>Text message spoofing</li>
        <li>GPS spoofing</li>
        <li>Man-in-the-middle attacks</li>
        <li>Extension spoofing</li>
        <li>IP spoofing</li>
        <li>Facial spoofing</li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      <b>SYN flood</b><br>
      A SYN flood is a form of denial-of-service attack in which an attacker sends a succession of SYN requests to a target's system in an attempt to consume enough server resources to make the system unresponsive to legitimate traffic.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>TCP sequence attack</b><br>
      A TCP sequence prediction attack is an attempt to predict the sequence number used to identify the packets in a TCP connection, which can be used to counterfeit packets. The attacker hopes to correctly guess the sequence number to be used by the sending host.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>TCP/IP hijacking</b><br>
      An attack in which the attacker gains access to a host in the network and logically disconnects it from the network. The attacker then inserts another machine with the same Internet Protocol (IP) address onto the network.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Teardrop attack</b><br>
      A Denial of Service (DoS) attack that uses large packets and odd offset values to confuse the receiver and help facilitate a crash.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Trojan horse</b><br>
      Any application that masquerades as one thing in order to get past scrutiny and then does something malicious. One of the major differences between Trojan horses and viruses is that Trojan horses tend not to replicate themselves.<br>
      <i>Storm Worm was a particularly vicious virus that made the rounds in 2006 with a subject line of ‘230 dead as storm batters Europe’. Intrigued, people would open the email and click on a link to the news story and that’s when the problems started.
      Storm Worm was a Trojan horse that infected computers, sometimes turning them into zombies or bots to continue the spread of the virus and to send a huge amount of spam mail.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Weak key attack</b><br>
      An attack that looks for cipher holes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Worm</b><br>
      A program similar to a virus. Worms, however, propagate themselves over a network.<br>
      <i>The ILOVEYOU worm was one of the biggest of all time. Also known as the Love Bug Worm and the VBS/Loveletter, the extremely harmful ILOVEYOU worm was able to spread like wildfire in 2000 because of its abilities to access the email addresses found in a user's Outlook contact list and send itself infinitely across the worldwide web while overwriting a victim's files.</i>
